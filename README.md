Welcome to the <span style="color: #FF5733;">Movie Recommender System</span>, your gateway to a personalized movie-watching experience!

## Overview

This end-to-end machine learning model leverages content-based recommendation techniques to bring you the perfect movies for every mood. The system is powered by the TMDB dataset and combines data preprocessing, vectorization, and cosine similarity to deliver tailored movie suggestions.

## How It Works

1. **<span style="color: #FF5733;">Data Processing:</span>** The TMDB dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to extract essential features such as movie titles, descriptions, and genres.

2. **<span style="color: #FF5733;">Text Vectorization:</span>** Movie descriptions undergo text vectorization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual content into numerical feature vectors.

3. **<span style="color: #FF5733;">Cosmic Cosine Similarity:</span>** Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between the vectorized descriptions of movies. Movies with similar vector angles are identified, representing those with comparable content and themes.

</div>

4. **<span style="color: #FF5733;">Recommendation Generation:</span>** Given a user's chosen movie, the system calculates the cosine similarity score between that movie and all others in the dataset. The top-n movies with the highest similarity scores are recommended, ensuring a personalized movie selection.

5. **<span style="color: #FF5733;">Deployment:</span>** The model is deployed using Streamlit, a user-friendly framework for creating interactive web applications. The system is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, making it accessible through a web browser.
